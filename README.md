# Task Manager

A functional and clean **to-do list application** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Users can add tasks with descriptions, set their priority, mark them as complete, and filter completed items.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created as part of a bootcamp assignment to practice core front-end development skills — particularly **form handling, DOM manipulation, and user interaction logic.**

- CSS  
- JavaScript

## ✅ Features

- Add tasks with title, description, and priority (Low, Medium, High)  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Delete tasks

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Using forms and validating input in JavaScript

- CSS styling for interactive states and visual feedback  
- Organizing event listeners and maintaining UI state

## 👀 Why This Project Matters

This isn't just a basic to-do app — it reflects thoughtful UX design, structured JavaScript logic, and attention to usability.  
A small but meaningful step in learning how real apps manage user input and state.
